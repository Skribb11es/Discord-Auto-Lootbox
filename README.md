## DISCLAIMER
Although it is highly unlikely that you will be banned for using this, there is a non-zero chance that you can be banned. It is imperative that you understand that there is some inherent risk when using automated tools to interact with Discord's APIs, as it is against their TOS.

## Usage

You can either compile your own version of this incredibly simple script by using [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org) or something similar or just run it locally by installing the pip package `requests` - `pip install requests`

### General Usage

* Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/Skribb11es/Discord-Auto-Lootbox/releases) `.exe` file, and move on to the next step.
* Once you have downloaded the latest `.exe`, you now need to locate your Discord Token. This can be done by following this guide by [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-get-discord-token/).
* Now that you have your discord token, open the `.exe` that you previously downloaded from the releases section.
* It should prompt you to enter your Discord Token, at which point take the token you just acquired and paste it into the console. Assuming all goes well, you should now see the program begin to open lootboxes for you automatically, each time printing out what you got.
* That's it, if you want to close the application, just do so as you would with any other application and close the X button.
